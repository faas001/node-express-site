            | I spent most of my youth growing up and experimenting with software and hardware.  Ask me about "hot swapping" modems back when I was a teen.  I drifted away from tech over the years and have recently renewed interest in pivoting back to software development.
            | The amount that technology has and continues to change has made it clear that the field will always have great opportunities for growth and continued learning; So I am making an concentrated effort to dive deep into learning and refreshing software skills.
            | In addition, I feel that the years that I have spent in more traditional 'business' roles has prepared me and gives me an edge when dealing with all positions and all levels of an organization. 
            | Culture is a big component of any successful team and I have the personality to interact and mesh with anyone. These soft skills are the intangibles that can make or break successful projects. 
            | I believe most people can be trained on the tech skills if they have the right 'continuous and relentless' learning mindset.
